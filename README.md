## Overview

The **ASIC Routing Visualization Tool** is an interactive educational platform designed to help users understand and visualize the detailed routing process in digital ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) design. This tool is primarily aimed at educators, students, and professionals looking to deepen their understanding of the digital ASIC flow, focusing on the routing phase, which is critical for ensuring optimal chip performance.

## Features

- **Interactive Visualization**: View the detailed routing layout in a visual format, allowing you to explore the paths and connections within an ASIC design.
- **Educational Focus**: The tool is tailored to help users learn and understand the complex routing process in digital ASIC design.
- **Real-time Updates**: See routing updates in real-time as you make changes to the design or rerun the routing process.
- **Customizable Layers**: Visualize routing across multiple layers, including the ability to highlight layer transitions and routing obstacles.
- **Extendable Architecture**: Designed with extensibility in mind, allowing easy addition of new features and algorithms.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Compatible with both Windows and macOS systems.
