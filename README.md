# Digital IC Router Simulator and Visualizer

## Overview
The **Digital IC Router Simulator and Visualizer** is an advanced tool designed to simulate the routing of digital Integrated Circuits (ICs) and visualize the various processes involved in their routing. This tool helps in understanding and optimizing the layout of ICs, ensuring efficient design and reduced errors in complex systems.

### Key Features:
- **Real-time Routing Simulation**: Simulates the routing process of digital ICs in real-time.
- **Visualizer**: Provides a graphical representation of the IC's routing, including wire paths, connection points, and pin configurations.
- **Interactive Interface**: Users can interact with the layout, modify design elements, and visualize the effects of changes.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Tailor the simulation settings to your specific IC design needs (e.g., layer configuration, wire width, etc.).
- **Error Detection**: Identifies potential design errors such as cross-talk, signal integrity issues, and routing violations.
  
## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python / C++ / JavaScript (choose the one you used)
- **Libraries & Frameworks**: 
  - [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) (for GUI in Python) / [Qt](https://www.qt.io/) (for C++)
  - [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) (for visualization) / [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) (for web-based projects)
  - [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) (for numerical calculations)
  - [NetworkX](https://networkx.github.io/) (for graph-based routing algorithms)
  
## Installation

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x or above (if applicable)
- C++/JavaScript development environment (if applicable)

### Install Dependencies
To install required Python dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, if using C++ or JavaScript, ensure that the necessary libraries and tools (e.g., Qt Creator for C++, Node.js for JavaScript) are installed on your system.

### Cloning the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine:

## Usage

1. **Create a New Design**: Start by defining the specifications of the digital IC layout, including the number of layers, types of connections, and pin configuration.
2. **Start Routing**: Use the routing interface to place wires, vias, and other components on the layout.
3. **Simulate Routing Process**: Click on the "Simulate" button to start the routing simulation. The tool will calculate the optimal paths and visualizations.
4. **Error Analysis**: Review the generated error reports to find any potential routing issues or design flaws.
5. **Save and Export**: Once you're satisfied with the layout, save your design or export it in a standard format for further use in IC design software.
